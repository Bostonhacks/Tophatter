# Tophatter
A simple python script that utilizes the selenium library and chromedriver package to interact with the tophat platform.
The purpose of the script is to ensure that attendance questions are answered. This script is not intended to answer questions intelligently.

*Currently not in a working condition for any system outside of the one it is written on. Next steps are to do arg parsing and generalize the script for use*
